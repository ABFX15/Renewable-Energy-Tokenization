# Renewable Energy Project NFT Platform ðŸŒ±âš¡

A decentralized platform enabling renewable energy project funding through NFT fractionalization.

## Overview

This platform allows renewable energy project owners to tokenize their projects as NFTs and enables investors to purchase fractions of these projects. By bridging the gap between renewable energy initiatives and decentralized finance, we're making green energy investment more accessible and efficient.
