# High Issues

## H-1: Uninitialized State Variables

Solidity does initialize variables by default when you declare them, however it's good practice to explicitly declare an initial value. For example, if you transfer money to an address we must make sure that the address has been initialized.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/EnergyNFT.sol [Line: 17](src/EnergyNFT.sol#L17)

	```solidity
	    uint256 private currentTokenId;
	```

</details>



## H-2: Sending native Eth is not protected from these functions.

Introduce checks for `msg.sender` in the function

	```solidity
	    function withdraw() external onlyOwner {

	```solidity
	    function claimReward(uint256 _projectId) external {
	```

</details>



## H-3: Return value of the function call is not checked.

Function returns a value but it is ignored.

	```solidity
	        energyNFT.mintNFT(msg.sender);
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

	```

- Found in src/FundProjects.sol [Line: 9](src/FundProjects.sol#L9)

	```solidity
	contract FundProjects is Ownable {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

	```solidity

</details>



## L-3: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

	```solidity
	        projectOwner = _projectOwner;
	```

</details>



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

	```solidity
	    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage) returns (string memory) {
	```

</details>



## L-5: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event RewardClaimed(uint256 indexed _projectId, address indexed _sender, uint256 _amount);
	```

</details>



## L-6: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-7: Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function



<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity

	```solidity
	    modifier validateProjectCreation(string memory _projectName, string memory _projectURI, uint256 _projectReturns) {
	```

</details>



## L-8: Internal functions called only once can be inlined

Instead of separating the logic into a separate function, consider inlining the logic into the calling function. This can reduce the number of function calls and improve readability.

	```solidity
	    function updateStakingProgress(uint256 _projectId) internal {
